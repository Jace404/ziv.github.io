      <h2>Quick Intro</h2>
      <p>
        This site is where I share my journey, projects, and ideas.  
        I believe in the power of innovation and faith to shape the future.  
        Here, you’ll find my thoughts, my work, and hopefully, some inspiration for your own journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t see faith and technology as opposites. Instead, I believe 
        they can walk hand in hand, guiding us toward building a future that is both 
        meaningful and impactful. This website is my little corner of the internet where 
        those ideas take shape.

      <h2>My Vision</h2>
      <p>
        I dream of a generation that is bold, creative, and unafraid to merge faith 
        with technology to bring lasting change. Too often, the two are separated — 
        but I believe the future belongs to those who can see the sacred even in 
        what looks ordinary, and who can use tools of today to build bridges for tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        My vision is to inspire people, especially young leaders, to live 
        authentically, innovate courageously, and lead with purpose.

      <h2>Projects I’m Working On</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of creative and leadership projects. 
        Some of them include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Faithware Podcast</strong> — exploring the intersection of technology and faith.</li>
        <li><strong>The New Age of Kingdom Trailblazers</strong> — a book I’m writing about leadership, faith, and innovation.</li>
        <li><strong>Youth Leadership Mentorship</strong> — helping young people discover their voice and potential.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe each of these projects is a stepping stone toward creating meaningful impact.

      <h2>Latest Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I regularly write about faith, technology, and leadership. Sometimes they come 
        as structured essays, other times as reflections from my personal journey.  
        Here are some themes I explore:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The role of creativity in building stronger communities</li>
        <li>How faith can guide our use of digital tools</li>
        <li>Why leadership is more about service than position</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stay tuned — I’ll be sharing more soon on my blog page.
